Among the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) projects, utilities like Entergy New Orleans (ENO), Reliant, and Central Maine Power (CMP) have deployed smart meters and offered web portals or notification systems to provide customers with detailed energy consumption data and usage insights.\n\nENO’s SmartView project included web portals to inform customers about reducing electricity consumption during critical peak events, with 82% of participating customers expressing satisfaction with the communication. While these engagements helped increase customer awareness and control, the report notes that the ultimate value of web portals in producing kWh savings remains an open question, as many utilities have found it challenging to attract customers to use these portals effectively.\n\nReliant continuously refined its web portal to enhance customer engagement and emphasized simplicity and ease of use, accompanied by frequent communications such as weekly emails about energy costs to prevent bill shock. \n\nCentral Maine Power used weekly text message notifications with high engagement and low opt-out rates.\n\nAlthough these utilities have successfully engaged customers through digital platforms leveraging AMI data, the published report does not provide definitive quantified kWh savings directly attributable to customer access to detailed consumption data. Thus, while customer engagement strategies have been effective in improving satisfaction and awareness, validated kWh savings as a direct result of these digital strategies remain inconclusive based on the referenced data.\n\nReferences to confirmed peak demand reductions were made specifically in the context of time-based rate pilot programs, such as in the SVE time-based rate pilot, rather than purely from web portal access.\n\nTherefore, NB Power can draw on experiences from these utilities to inform customer engagement strategy design, but acknowledging that measured kWh savings from customer self-service web portals and AMI data access alone are not yet conclusively demonstrated in the literature. Continued emphasis on customer education, ease of use, and multi-channel communication is critical to achieving positive outcomes.\n\nIf further detailed quantitative impact studies are needed, additional sources beyond the provided references may be required.", "reference": "There is documented evidence that providing customers with AMI-enabled digital access and feedback can result in validated energy savings. CMP’s Bill Alert program, supported by a customer web portal that allowed users to monitor energy use and costs, achieved approximately a 1.8% annual reduction in electricity consumption among participants, with about 70% reporting that the alerts prompted them to take action.
